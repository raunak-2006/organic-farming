    <h1><i><u>Who we Are</u></i></h1>

    <b>The Organic Research Centre (ORC) is the UK’s leading independent organic research organisation.</b><br>
    <p>From climate emergency to food security, the way we farm is key to solving some of the biggest issues facing us today.<br> 
        Changes in our agricultural practices have never been more needed. If we continue intensive farming, we will be responsible<br> 
        for the continued decline of many species, including pollinators, soil organisms and the natural enemies of pests. Habitats will <br>
        continue to be degraded, and pollution levels will rise.</p><br>

    <p>It doesn’t have to be that way. Our in-the-field research and knowledge exchange activity enables the transition to naturally<br> 
       healthy and resilient farming systems. We build evidence and understanding of the positive impact of organic and agroecological <br>
       farming, and practical information to help farmers and growers do it better.</p><br>

    <p>We provide continuing research into organic and agroecological farming methods to improve the uptake, efficiency and development<br>
        of organic farming, and to help agriculture fulfil the principles of health, ecology, fairness and care.We’ve been exploring <br>
        better ways to farm and feed ourselves, and safeguard natural resources, from many different angles since 1980.Working with a <br>
        varied network of collaborators, including universities, research institutes and leaders in British and European agriculture, <br>
        our scientific research is based on:</p><br>

    <p><b>Diversification.</b> Harnessing the diversity of living organisms to fit agricultural production within ecological cycles.</p>
    <p><b>Integration.</b> Following an interdisciplinary approach mirroring the interactions between the different components of agriculture,<br>
         from genes to society.</p>
    <p><b>Participation.</b> Working with farmers and other stakeholders to identify problems, co-create knowledge and work towards<br> 
         practical and applicable solutions.</p>

            <h1><i><u>Knowledge Exchange</u></i></h1>

            <p>Co-innovation is at the core of ORC’s work. In our Knowledge Exchange and Policy work we expand the<br> 
            accessibility of the results of our research beyond those directly involved. This bridges the gap between our<br> 
            research and its application in a real world setting by effectively communicating our results, in tailored formats,<br> 
            to decision makers in agriculture and associated industries.</p><br>
            <p>Decision makers can range from politicians and civil servants to individual farmers working to manage<br> 
            their farm according to organic principles to conservation organisations looking to understand how organic<br> 
            and agroecological farming can contribute to protecting nature. Ultimately, we aim to deliver the behavioural <br>
            change necessary for fair transition to better farming systems.</p><br>
            <p>Our team works to ensure that our research is available to food and farming practitioners in the best formats<br> 
            possible. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with any questions</p><br>
